# Haskell ArangoDB Client
This is a haskell client for the ArangoDB REST API. Its currently for my own personal use and will only have the
functionality I need. Anyone who discovers this repo my use the client at their own risk. I currently have no intent
to create elaborate test cases or fully implement the API. My use case for this is fairly limited, so only a small
subset of the API will be implemented. I also have no intent to currently publish this to any shared package
repository (e.g. hackage or stackage).

**Contributions are always welcome!**
